# copy file from container to host machine

{ We can copy files from container to Host machine using the following command ==> for the debugging purpose }

1. vagrant ssh
2. docker container ps
3. docker container exec -it container_name bash
   ls                                               = lets copy entrypoint.sh from here
   pwd
   exit

4. docker container cp container_name:source_path destination_path
       where, 
                source_path = container bhitra ko tyo file path

5. docker container cp lucid_merkle:/docker-entrypoint.sh .                 = copy file from container to host machine
   here the file was in slash(/) when checked using pwd so docker-entrypoint.sh path will be --> /docker-entrypoint.sh

6. ls
7. touch hello.txt                                  = now copy this file to container
   ls

8. docker container cp hello.txt lucid_merkle:/opt
   docker container cp hello.txt container_name: copy_destination_path
